PART 1

a) look at file A.java

b) look at file B.java and C.java
we have to make "B extends C" and "C implements A"

c)

d) C can't be Interface:
    -because he must Implements A and interface can't implements another interface
    -another way is to make "interface C extend A" but we have another problem if we make this,
     we can't do "arrA[2]  =  new C();" without implement f() , g() and h() methods
